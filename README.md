# HTMLCoin-Windows-Miner Version 0.0.7

Its only a **GUI** (grafic user interface) for the official (https://github.com/HTMLCOIN/HTMLCOIN/releases) **htmlcoin-cli.exe**.
You must have install a HTML-Wallet, but it can be empty (the App will say it to you). 

The WindowsMiner.exe start the GUI for Mining HTML Coins.
For each CPU/Core you can start on Mining Tread.
If you have 2 CPUs with 2 Cores you can start 3 Treads (one for you to work).

Its a very young ALPHA Version and i must put in some more work...

Thinks to do:

- Show a report if we have found a Block.
- Open Sourcecode - later if i have become some more Donate HTMls...
- Merge Bugs you tell me.....
- ~~Save the HTMLCoin Adress for a restart.~~ Finish in Version 0.0.7
- ~~An Option for the search deep (99999999).~~ Finish in Version 0.0.7
- ~~Make sure, that the Miners are Stopp when the GUI Closed.~~ Finish in Version 0.0.7
