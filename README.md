# HTMLCoin-Windows-Miner Version 0.0.5

Its only a GUI (grafic user interface) for the official (https://github.com/HTMLCOIN/HTMLCOIN/releases) htmlcoin-cli.exe.
You must have install a HTML-Wallet, but it can be empty (the App will say it to you). 

The WindowsMiner.exe start the GUI for Mining HTML Coins.
For each CPU/Core you can start on Mining Tread.
If you have 2 CPUs with 2 Cores you can start 3 Treads (one for you to work).

Its a very young ALPHA Version and i must put in some more work...

Thinks to do:

1. Save the HTMLCoin Adress for a restart.
2. An Option for the search deep (99999999).
3. Make sure, that the Miners are Stopp when the GUI Closed.
4. Merge Bugs you tell me.....
