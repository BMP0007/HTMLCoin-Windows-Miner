# HTMLCoin-Windows-Miner Version 0.0.7

Its only a **GUI** (grafic user interface) for the official (https://github.com/HTMLCOIN/HTMLCOIN/releases) **htmlcoin-cli.exe**.
You must have install a HTML-Wallet, but it can be empty (the App will say it to you). 

The WindowsMiner.exe start the GUI for Mining HTML Coins.
For each CPU/Core you can start on Mining Tread.
If you have 2 CPUs with 2 Cores you can start 3 Treads (one for you to work).

Its a very young ALPHA Version and i must put in some more work...

Thinks to do:

[ ] Show a report if we have found a Block.
[ ] Merge Bugs you tell me.....
[x] ~~Save the HTMLCoin Adress for a restart.~~
[x] ~~An Option for the search deep (99999999).~~
[x] ~~Make sure, that the Miners are Stopp when the GUI Closed.~~
[ ] Merge Bugs you tell me.....
